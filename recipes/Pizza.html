    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base
      of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often
      various other ingredients (such as various types of sausage, anchovies,
      mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham, etc.), which is then
      baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A
      small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is
      known as a pizzaiolo.
