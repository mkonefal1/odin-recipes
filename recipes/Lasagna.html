    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      Lasagne are a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types,[2] made of
      very wide, flat sheets. Either term can also refer to an Italian dish made
      of stacked layers of lasagne alternating with fillings such as ragù(ground
      meats and tomato sauce), vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta,
      mozzarella, and parmesan), and seasonings and spices, like Italian
      seasoning, such as garlic, oregano and basil.[3] The dish may be topped
      with grated cheese, which becomes melted after baking. Typically cooked
      pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven.
      The resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving square portions.

      <li>1 (16 ounce) package small-curd cottage cheese</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>5 (6 inch) corn tortillas, halved</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook
          and stir until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in ground
          turkey; cook until no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Drain excess
          grease.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Stir enchilada sauce and diced tomatoes into the pot. Simmer until
          flavors combine, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Mix cottage cheese, egg, and cumin together in a small bowl.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Spread 1/3 of the turkey sauce in the bottom of an 8-inch baking dish.
          Cover with 1/2 of the corn tortillas. Spread 1/2 of the cottage cheese
          mixture on top. Sprinkle 1/3 of the Mexican cheese on top. Repeat
          layers once more, ending with remaining turkey sauce and Mexican
          cheese.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Spray a large piece of aluminum foil with cooking spray; cover the
          baking dish with aluminum foil.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, about 30 minutes. Remove
          aluminum foil and continue baking until top is browned, about 15
          minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving. Garnish with green onion.
