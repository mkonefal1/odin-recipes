    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      Falafel is a deep-fried ball or patty-shaped fritter in Middle Eastern
      cuisine (especially in Levantine and Egyptian cuisines) made from ground
      chickpeas, broad beans, or both. Nowadays, falafel is often served in a
      pita, which acts as a pocket, samoon, or wrapped in a flatbread known as
      taboon; "falafel" also frequently refers to a wrapped sandwich that is
      prepared in this way. The falafel balls may be topped with salads, pickled
      vegetables, hot sauce, and drizzled with tahini-based sauces. Falafel
      balls may also be eaten alone as a snack or served as part of a meze tray
      (assortment of appetizers).

          Soak chickpeas in a large amount of cool water for 24 hours. Rub the
          soaked chickpeas with your fingers to help loosen and remove skins.
          Rinse and drain well. Spread chickpeas on a large clean dish towel to
          dry.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Blend chickpeas, cilantro, parsley, onion, and garlic in a food
          processor until a rough paste forms. Transfer mixture to a large bowl.
          Add chickpea flour, coriander, cumin, sriracha, salt, and pepper and
          mix well. Cover bowl and let mixture rest for 1 hour.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Preheat an air fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Add baking powder and baking soda to the chickpea mixture. Mix using
          your hands until just combined. Form 15 equal-sized balls and press
          slightly to form patties. Spray falafel patties with cooking spray.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Place 7 falafel patties in the preheated air fryer and cook for 10
          minutes. Transfer cooked falafel to a plate and repeat with remaining
          8 falafel, cooking for 10 to 12 minutes.
